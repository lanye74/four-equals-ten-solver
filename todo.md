### todo
- ~~generalize tokenizer~~
- ~~eval should handle malformed input~~
- ~~eval should support layered parentheses & multiple pairs~~
	- no need for these. that is beyond the scope of this project and will only slow things down
	- if i really wanted to implement these i should just make a seperate math evaluator project
- option to deduplicate pemdas-equivalent parentheses ("simplify solutions"?)
	- e.g. (1+2)+3+4 = 1+2+3+4. remove parentheses solution
- support command-line args
	- --rapid - allow inputs one after another (1234 --> "1+2+3+4" --> wait for number input again)
	- -y - accept all defaults
- look into removing tokenizer::tokenize.
	- i found that a quick and dirty implementation changing build_expression\[_with_parentheses] to build a Vec&lt;Token&gt; improved performance greatly
	- roughly 3.7s --> 2.7s for n=6 which is... a lot
	- however, the tradeoff is that it's harder to display solutions now (as they're not strings)
