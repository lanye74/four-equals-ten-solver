# four-equals-ten-solver
A Rust brute-forcer for the mobile game 4=10.

It's definitely poorly written but I'm still learning Rust and have made major progress in optimizing it.

Use is very simple: just clone the repository and `cargo run --release`. Then, follow the prompts to configure your input.

Note that for the digit input, digits can be entered in any format (e.g. `1234`, `1 2 3 4`, `1, 2, 3, 4`, etc.)


# command line arguments

### --silent-output
Does not print solutions. Useful for benchmarking code.
